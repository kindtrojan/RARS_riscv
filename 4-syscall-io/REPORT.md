##reused putc function and changed the syscall to PrintInt: 
we could just use printInt instead of PrintChar to get ascii code of the input char.
similiar to printing a char in c using %d in printf
(could have created a copy function with printint instead of changing putc, but for this assignment it serves the purpose)

Ascii codes of following chars are:

```# 35```

```u 117```

```$ 36```
